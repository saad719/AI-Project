Applied unsuperwised Learning technique for customer segmentation and purchase prediction
Project3: Customer Segmentation and Purchase Prediction Analysis

Objective:
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their behavior and demographics
and predict their future purchases. Additionally, we'll employ machine learning techniques,
including neural networks, to segment customers and predict purchase behavior.

Dataset:
You can use a real-world dataset such as the Online Retail dataset or the E-commerce Customer
Behavior dataset. The Online Retail dataset contains transactional data, including customer
purchases and demographics, while the E-commerce Customer Behavior dataset provides
information about customer interactions with an e-commerce platform, such as browsing
history, cart additions, and purchases.

Steps:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
• Load the dataset and explore its structure and features.
• Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data transformations.
• Explore descriptive statistics and visualize distributions of relevant features.
2. Customer Segmentation:
• Utilize clustering algorithms such as K-means or hierarchical clustering to segment customers
based on features like purchase history, demographics, and browsing behavior.
• Visualize the clusters using techniques like scatter plots or dendrograms to understand the
characteristics of each segment.
3. Feature Selection:
• Employ techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, or feature importance from
tree-based models to select the most relevant features for predicting future purchases.
• Explain why certain features were chosen or discarded based on their impact on purchase
prediction.
4. Purchase Prediction:
• Split the data into training and testing sets.

• Implement machine learning models (logistic regression) to predict whether a customer will
make a purchase in the future based on selected features.
• Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. Neural Network:
• Implement a basic neural network (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch) for purchase prediction.
• Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and regularization techniques.
• Compare neural network results with logistic regression model.
6. Purchase Prediction Evaluation:
• Analyze the performance of the purchase prediction model and interpret evaluation metrics.
• Discuss the implications of model performance for the business, such as identifying high-value
customers and optimizing marketing strategies.
Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebook or a similar document detailing:
• Data preprocessing steps.
• Customer segmentation results and visualizations.
• Feature selection process and chosen features.
• Implementation and evaluation of segmentation models.
• Neural network implementation and comparison.
Visualizations:
• Clusters of customers on a map (if applicable).
• Scatter plots showing customer purchase behavior vs. selected features.
• Regression plots demonstrating model predictions.
Conclusion:
• Discuss the insights gained from customer segmentation.
• Analyze the impact of different features on customer purchase behavior.
• Compare the performance of segmentation models and neural networks.
• Reflect on the importance of feature selection in improving model accuracy for
predicting customer purchase behavior.
